# Hello World

This is my first blog post using **pho**! 

## Features I'm excited about

- Simple markdown-to-HTML conversion
- Future-proof file format
- Minimal configuration
- Easy publishing workflow
- Topic-based organization instead of date folders
- Auto-tagging from folder structure

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, pho!")
}
```

Looking forward to writing more posts with this simple tool. This post will automatically get the "pesronal" tag from being in the `posts/personal/` folder!
