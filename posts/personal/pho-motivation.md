## What is pho?
`pho` is a tiny blog generator. Its input is a folder of md files and its output is a static website

## Why did I make this?
The basic motiviation was the following:
 
- Make blogging easier
- I am very good at making markdown every day, I am not good at remembering various frameworks like hugo every time I want to publish an idea
- Make a .MD file, generate and publish (or cook and serve) through CLI
- Have an empty metadata section at the top of each file to help interpret what to do later (future proofing)
- jekyl/octa/hugo without all the bs (I actually have endless respect for these projects, I just always forget what I was doing when I don't blog for a while)
